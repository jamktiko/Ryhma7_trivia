# Mindspark

The player is greeted with a choice of 4 categories
- Sports 
- History
- Geography
- Animals.

After they've made their choice they have 20 seconds to answer per question, with the first 5 seconds giving full points. Every second more that they spend on answering the question after those 5 seconds they lose a point. If they cannot answer at all, they lose all points for that question and automatically move to the next. After they've gone through all questions they are taken to the end page where their point total is tallied, highest score is shown and they can choose to either play again or switch categories.
