# Mindspark

A trivia game, where the player answers as fast as possible to get the highest score.

## Description

The player is greeted with a choice of 4 categories, Sports, History, Geography and Animals. After they've made their choice they have 20 seconds to answer per question, with the first 5 seconds giving full points. Every second more that they spend on answering the question after those 5 seconds they lose a point. If they cannot answer at all, they lose all points for that question and automatically move to the next. After they've gone through all questions they are taken to the end page where their point total is tallied, highest score is shown and they can choose to either play again or switch categories.

## Getting Started

### Installing

### Executing program

- Clone the repository found at https://github.com/jamktiko/Ryhma7_trivia.
- Run these two commands at the root of your repository to first install npm and then to run it:
```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```
- You will be shown a local link that looks something like this "http://localhost:xxxx/". Copy it and paste it in your browser.
- You've not created a local link that you can use to access the game. 

- The next time you want to run the program you just need to follow the instructions from "npm run dev" forward.

## Help

- If "npm run dev" doesn't work, follow the instruction in terminal to download npm.
- The game is not recommended to be run on a device with a height less than 580px. On mobile phones portrait mode is highly recommended. 
- If you run into problems, refresh the page either by pressing the logo at the top of the web page or by pressing the refresh-button built into the web browser. Keep in mind, that this will delete all your progress.
